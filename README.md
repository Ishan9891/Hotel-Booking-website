# Hotel-Booking-website
Website is created via ASP .NET using C#. Software used are Visual Studio 2010 ( for front + back end development) , SQl server management 2008 ( for DB) and Crystal Report ( for generating booking receipts). For reference ITC hotels are taken for booking . User can book rooms in hotels of ITC using it only if there desired room in desired hotel is available (i.e vacant rooms are there.) For doing so a great logic is being developed. For more info regarding this logic checkout this link https://akshaykhanna93.wordpress.com/2014/09/14/searching-for-booking-website-logic/
